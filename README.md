# LASD_library, a C++ Data Structures Library

This repository contains C++ libraries implementing fundamental data structures, including vectors, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables. 
This library was developed as part of the "Laboratory of Algorithms and Data Structures" course of 2023/2024 taught by Professor Fabio Mogavero at the University of Naples "Federico II".

## Overview

The library in this repository provides implementation of various data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. 
These structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently in various applications and algorithms.

## Features

- **Vectors**: Dynamic arrays that can resize themselves automatically.
- **Lists**: Linear collections of elements, each pointing to the next one.
- **Stacks**: Last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structures.
- **Queues**: First-in, first-out (FIFO) data structures.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structures with nodes connected by edges.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing fast retrieval based on keys.

## Getting Started

To use these libraries, simply clone the repository to your local machine and include the desired header files in your C++ projects.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/baddiejay/LASD_library.git
```

Go to the folder Exercise3 and run the following command

```sh
make clean && make
```

Then launch the main with the command

```sh
./main
```
